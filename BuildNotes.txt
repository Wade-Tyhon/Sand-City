Tips: 


To begin, search for WSL and open it
After opening WSL, it should start you in the root folder (in my case wadetyhon)
Navigate to your folder 


Quick Commands:

"cd ~" to go to root
"cd /*" *insert directory name here to navigate to your project's location 
"ls" to list the contents of the current directory
"make clean" to rebuild the entire project
"make" to only rebuild files that have recently changed in the project


For Updating Libdragon:

"./build.sh" to rebuild in the libdragon folder
